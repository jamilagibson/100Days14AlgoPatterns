# 100Days14AlgoPatterns

Goal: Master 14 algorithmic patterns through ~42 curated problems over 14 weeks as part of #100DaysOfCode. 

Each pattern contains 3 problems with clean, well-commented TypeScript solutions.

Prerequisites: Basic TypeScript and data structures knowledge

Why these 14 patterns?

These are some of the most common patterns that appear in coding interviews. Mastering them builds problem-solving intuition rather than rote memorization. By recognizing patterns, the aim is to develop transferable skills that help us recognize and solve new problems efficiently.

The list below is subject to change:
